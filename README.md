## A way to solve firebase phone authentication issue with react native

If you stuck by the Google firebase phone Auth in react native, maybe this tutorial is helpful, the solution is not fully belongs to me, but I made some adaptations and now it's praticle on React Native CLI.

### Creat a captcha.html and deploy it on firebase and enable cross-origin.

### Import Webview component in your app, in this way you will not have to be navigated to a browser which is another app.

### Write your javascript code and realize the dataflow between Webview and your app.
